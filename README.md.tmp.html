<h3>Get started with Apple Business Manager</h3>

<p>Whether your organization has ten devices or ten thousand, Apple fits easily into your existing infrastructure. Zero-touch deployment allows IT to configure and manage remotely, and IT can tailor the setup process to any team. So every Mac, iPad, iPhone, and Apple TV is ready to go from the start.</p>

<h2>For Education</h2>

<h3>Get started with Apple School Manager</h3>

<p>Whether you’re planning a brand new deployment, or adding Apple devices into your existing infrastructure, iPad and Mac fit right in. And now with Microsoft Azure Active Directory support, it’s easier than ever to provide your students and staff with access to key Apple services for teaching and learning. All the apps and services your teachers and students need every day, like Google Drive and Microsoft Office, are available on iPad. And with the countless creative tools iPad offers, students are empowered to express their learning any way they like.</p>

<h3>About Provisioning.zsh sample script</h3>

<p>This is the same Mac script (iOS devices cannot run scripts) deployed at the end of the video demonstrating a provisioning workflow. Reuse and modify as you like. It includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A function for creating a log file at /var/log/Provisioning.log.</li>
<li>A wait loop that prevents the script from continuing to run until a user has logged in and a Dock appears.</li>
<li>An example for displaying a dialog to the end user for entering an asset tag number or other piece of information.</li>
<li>A loop for displaying a JamfHelper full screen window to display progress</li>
<li>An update inventory command that also populates the Asset Tag field in a device record ( /usr/local/bin/jamf recon -assetTag "$assetTag" ).</li>
<li>A restart command with a delay of one minute to allow the policy to complete and update the log in Jamf Pro.</li>
</ul>

<p>To use this script as-is, modify this section near the beginning of the script to include statuses and custom trigger names for the policies you wish to run in the order they should run. Consider installing security software that may scan activity toward the end of the installation.</p>

<blockquote>

Installing Microsoft Office 2019,maininstallmicrosoftoffice
Installing Zoom,main-zoom
